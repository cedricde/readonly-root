# Type of overlay filesystem (tmpfs|ext4|btrfs|xfs).
# Overriden by stateless.fstype= on kernel command line but only to disable
# stateless mechanism (if empty) or to use tmpfs.
STATELESS_FSTYPE=tmpfs

# Default mount options for overlay filesystem.
# Overriden by stateless.flags= on kernel command line.
STATELESS_FLAGS=

# Default device to use for overlay filesystem.
# Overriden by stateless.device= on kernel command line.
# It can be either a path, PARTLABEL= or PARTUUID=; LABEL= and UUID= are
# obviously NOT suitable. It is not used if STATELESS_FSTYPE is tmpfs.
STATELESS_DEVICE=PARTLABEL=volatile-device

# Name of the volatile filesystem.
# This is used for sanity checking to prevent erasing wrong device. This value
# shall be suitable for the filesystem type chosen above.
